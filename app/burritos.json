This was my first breakfast burrito so I'm hoping it's just that I don't like them, but between the chorizo, scrambled eggs, cheese, and hash the burrito was incredibly dry. It kinda hurt to eat. No matter how much of her great salsa or hot sauce I poured on top, it still was hard to eat.\nThe flavor of the burrito didn't work either. All the ingredients came together into this weird homogenous taste without any distinction. It tasted like numbness.\nI was able to power through several bites through the power of my love for Mom, but unfortunately it wasn't enough.\nI'm sorry Mom, but I've become a pretentious douche.\n"

I didn't practice eating Mexican food all these years for nothing. I knew my capabilities well - I'm able to eat two fat burritos back-to-back with room to spare.\nI had two friends hyping me up. Their cashier was gassing me up too. He was like \"are you hungry? if so, then it'll be easy\".\nI knew I could easily conquer this.\nI started with the crunchwrap. It's basically a hybrid between a burrito and a quesadilla. Or at least it should be. It was filled with mac & cheese? and barbeque sauce? Did it even qualify as Mexican food? I ate most of the crunchwrap in a few minutes, but as I kept eating it, it got more and more painful. There was some meat in it, but they were rigid cubes that were tough to chew.\nI finished the crunchwrap in ten minutes, leaving over twenty minutes to eat just a plate of fries. A 14\" wide plate of fries. Covered in cheese and bacon. I was already painfully full. All of the fries were stuck together into one cheesy amalgamation, so I had to prod at this pile for a loose piece as if I was playing Jenga. I finally found one, extracted it, and ate it. Not only were these fries covered in cheese and bacon, but apparently also four sticks of butter. These fries were <i>heavy</i>.\nMy friends told me if I didn't finish that plate of fries, I'd be a failure for the rest of my life. I forfeited anyway."

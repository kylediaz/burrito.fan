# Burrito Map

When I interned in California, I lived off burritos. I ate probably dozens of
burritos that summer alone. Ever since, eating burritos has become my
hobby and I made it my life's mission to eat one burrito from every restaurant
in the world.

This map keeps track of all the burritos I've eaten.

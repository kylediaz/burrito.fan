      <li>Served with plain diced tomatoes instead of salsa. Pico de gallo is something perfectly fine to put inside a burrito, but on the side? What am I supposed to do with that? Additionally, they tasted like they came from a can.</li>
      <li>The burrito was  70% rice.</li>
      <li>The burrito was completely dry. There was no sour cream or anything. Normally that's fine because I could just pour salsa on it - but remember - all I had was diced tomatoes.</li>

    <p>The restaurant is owned the nicest abuela ever - "Mom". She's a little old woman who kept making sure were were ok, bringing an absurd amount of free chips and salsa to our table, calling us her muchahos and guapo, and giving us little hugs.</p>
    <p>The chips and salsa were really good. The chips had a surprising amount of flavor on their own, and the salsa had the perfect blend of spicy and sweet while definitely being freshly made. Nirmal ordered orange juice which looked homemade.</p>
    <p>The burrito itself... I'm sorry Mom, but I didn't like it. This was my first breakfast burrito so I'm hoping it's just that I don't like them, but between the chorizo, scrambled eggs, cheese, and hash the burrito was incredibly dry. It kinda hurt to eat. No matter how much of her great salsa or hot sauce I poured on top, it still was hard to eat.</p>
    <p>The flavor of the burrito didn't work either. All the ingredients came together into this weird homogenous taste without any distinction. It tasted like numbness.</p>
    <p>I was able to power through several bites through the power of my love for Mom, but unfortunately it wasn't enough.</p>

  description: Not a burrito. They had a food challenge - if you finish a
    "crunchwrap" and a plate of fries within 30 minutes, the meal is free and
    you get a T-shirt. I didn't practice eating Mexican food all these years for
    nothing. I knew my capabilities well - I'm able to eat two fat burritos
    back-to-back with room to spare.

    I had two friends hyping me up. Their cashier was gassing me up too. He was
    like "are you hungry? if so, then it'll be easy".

    I knew I could easily conquer this.

    I started with the crunchwrap. It's basically a hybrid between a burrito and
    a quesadilla. Or at least it should be. It was filled with mac & cheese? and
    barbeque sauce? Did it even qualify as Mexican food? I ate most of the
    crunchwrap in a few minutes, but as I kept eating it, it got more and more
    painful. There was some meat in it, but they were rigid cubes that were
    tough to chew.

    I finished the crunchwrap in ten minutes, leaving over twenty minutes to eat
    just a plate of fries. A 14" wide plate of fries. Covered in cheese and
    bacon. I was already painfully full. All of the fries were stuck together
    into one cheesy amalgamation, so I had to prod at this pile for a loose
    piece as if I was playing Jenga. I finally found one, extracted it, and ate
    it. Not only were these fries covered in cheese and bacon, but apparently
    also four sticks of butter. These fries were <i>heavy</i>.

    My friends told me if I didn't finish that plate of fries, I'd be a failure
    for the rest of my life. I forfeited anyway.

    <p>It was a diner-like restaurant in the middle of nowhere, so I wasn't expecting anything. The food looked weird, but actually tasted great.</p>
    <p>I admit, I had a bit of a pretentious attitude where I believed the best food can be found only in the city. This restaurant definitely gave me a change of heart.</p>

    <p>The burrito <i>should</i> have been good. It felt like the underlying burrito was pretty good,
    but for some reason the burrito was filled with this burned-tasted liquid. I suspect that they
    use liquid smoke in order to make their meat taste as if it was smoked. If so, they put way too much.</p>
    <p>It's also pretty small for the price.</p>

    <p>This restaurant got <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVdmMl5lopq/?hl=en">a lot of media attention</a> because it used to be based in the owner's home kitchen. They would make it in their apartment and then lower it down from their window in a bucket. They became popular enough that they were able to move to to a food court in Hudson Yards.</p>
    <p>It's very... artisinal. It used a lot of bougie ingredients like "lemongrass" but I can't say if it worked. I love kimchi and now I wish I could eat every burrito with it instead of pickled red onions.</p>
    <p>It's also very, very oily.</p>

This is by the NYU campus so they probably usually serve rich kids but I still couldn't help feeling ripped off. It tasted good though, would be even better if they put rice or vegetables in it too.
